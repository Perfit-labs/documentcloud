  TYPE STYLE GUIDE

  - Use Gotham ScreenSmart (`'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B'`) for normal sizes
    (<=18px), which effectively means everything except H1-H3
  - Use Gotham (`'Gotham A', 'Gotham B'`) for large headlines (>18px)
  - Use font weight 300 (light) for most text
  - Use font weight 700 (bold) for bold text
  - Don't use bold in H1-H3; if it becomes necessary, we'll need to add 
    Gotham's 700 variant to the font package
  - Fall back to the opposite package (ScreenSmart falls back to non-ScreenSmart
    and vice versa), then fall back to system Gotham, then to acceptable Gotham
    substitutes that maybe two designers will have installed
